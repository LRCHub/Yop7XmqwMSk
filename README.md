[00:00.06] Destiny is mine
[00:02.26] My fear won't bother me
[00:04.26] That never-ending flow of love is in my heart
[00:08.56] Shoot a thread of light
[00:20.06] 
[00:17.33] I feel no pain
[00:20.89] Diamonds come with the rain
[00:25.13] My heart and soul are sharpened by
[00:29.95] The brightest light of all (brightest light)
[00:34.74] On and on I hear your voice
[00:38.28] Your voice will guide me as if my fate
[00:43.13] So I swear to the shining ocean now
[00:47.52] Guide me through, I will survive and show you someday
[00:53.54] The reason I'm here
[01:03.04] 
[00:58.20] Heaven's falling down, the sky is breaking down
[01:02.28] But I know I will survive, until the end of time
[01:07.07] Destiny is mine, my fear won't bother me
[01:11.23] That never-ending flow of love is in my heart
[01:15.74] Shoot a thread of light
[01:27.24] 
[01:29.52] I chose my fate
[01:33.91] No one can take it away
[01:38.29] The wings of hope and freedom will
[01:42.91] Always be all by my side (all by my side)
[01:48.33] I see fading lights ahead
[01:51.67] And I can hear a prayer in my heart
[01:56.35] I believe it's worth fighting for
[02:00.82] Stay with me, I need you by my side
[02:05.32] No matter how hard it might be
[02:20.32] 
[02:11.49] Heaven's falling down, my world is breaking down
[02:15.70] It's all in my blood until the end of time
[02:20.40] Destiny is mine, I won't surrender
[02:24.53] As long as I can survive, the power is in me
[02:28.76] Shoot a thread of light
[02:40.26] 
[02:57.06] The stars are shining more in darkest blaze of war
[03:01.99] So I turn the flame of light will burn bright in me
[03:27.49] 
[03:06.92] Destiny is mine
[03:08.88] My fear won't bother me
[03:10.68] That never-ending flow of love of that is in my heart
[03:14.96] Shoot a thread of light
[03:19.73] The glow of life is in my eyes
